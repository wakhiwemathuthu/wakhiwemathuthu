# About Me:
As a web app and hybrid mobile app developer, I specialize in utilizing a combination of powerful technologies such as React, React Native, Firebase, Supabase, and Node.js to create innovative and high-performing applications. 

With React, I have the ability to build robust and interactive user interfaces for web applications. React's component-based architecture allows for modular development, making it easier to manage complex UI elements and enhance the overall user experience. By utilizing React's virtual DOM, I can ensure faster rendering and seamless updates, resulting in a smooth and responsive application.

When it comes to hybrid mobile app development, React Native is my go-to framework. With React Native, I can leverage my existing knowledge of React to build cross-platform mobile applications that have native-like performance and appearance. This allows me to save time and effort, as a single codebase can be used to develop applications for both iOS and Android platforms.

To handle the backend infrastructure and database management, I work with Firebase and Supabase. Firebase provides a comprehensive suite of cloud services, including real-time database, authentication, storage, and hosting, allowing me to quickly develop scalable and secure applications. Supabase, on the other hand, is an open-source alternative that provides similar features and functionalities.
